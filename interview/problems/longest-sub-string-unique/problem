Find the longest substring with k unique characters in a given string

Given a string you need to print longest possible substring that has exactly k unique characters. If there are more than one substring of longest possible length, then print any one of them.

Examples:
̉̉̉̉
"aabbcc", k = 1
Max substring can be any one from {"aa" , "bb" , "cc"}.
Output: "aa"

"aabbcc", k = 2
Max substring can be any one from {"aabb" , "bbcc"}.
Output: "aabb"

"aabbcc", k = 3
There are substrings with exactly 3 unique characters
{"aabbcc" , "abbcc" , "aabbc" , "abbc" }

Output: "aabbcc"

"aaabbb", k = 3
There are only two unique characters, thus show error message. 
Output: "Not found"
